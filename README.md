# musicalCube
A musical Cube is an improvisation musical instrument which allows people to play chords when simulating Rubik's cube.

A GUI as below is designed to simplify the operations.
<div align = "center"><img height = "600" src="https://github.com/JiayingLi0803/musicalCube/blob/main/Images/GUI.png"></div>
By clicking operation buttons on the GUI page, people are able to play or download their music.
